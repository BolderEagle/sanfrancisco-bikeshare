### 1. Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Fordgobike trip dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area for the month of February, 2019. There are 183,412 bike share entries in the original dataset with 16 variables (duration in seconds, start-time, end-time, start station id, name, latitude, longtitue, end station id, name, latitude, longtitude, bike id, user type, user birth year, user gender, bike share for all trip). Most variables are numeric in nature, with the exception of categorical entries such as user type, station name, and date/time.


### 2. Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

This project was created using Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook using the language python. The following language and packages were used:

- python 3.7.11
- pandas 1.3.5
- numpy 1.21.5
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- seaborn 0.11.2


### 3. Key Files <a name="keyfiles"></a>

The project consist of two main files: 
- #### Part I- Data Exploration: 
`Part_I_exploration.ipynb` and `Part_I_exploration.html`  
In the Exploration section, I used variety of plotting techniques to explore the dataset from single variable exploration to multivariable exploration to understand the data and its relation to one another.
- #### Part II- Data Explanation: 
`Part_II_slide_deck.ipynb` and `Part_II_slide_deck.slides.html`
In the Data Explanation section of my project, I focused on key findings to explain the relationships of variables and their impact on the outcome. 
-- Dataset used: `201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv`

### 4. Summary of Findings <a name="findings"></a>

- The customer age, distance traveled, and datetime data can be interpreted as such that the riders are mostly regular customers who chose to become subscribers. 
- Most of these users were young men in their 30s who used the bikes mostly during the week to go short distances, which might mean they are being used mostly for transportation to work, rather than leisurely rides. 
- There were more female riders on the weekends than males.
- On the weekends the average age of riders were slightly older, and the duration of rentals were longer. Which can be interpreted as weekend riders were using the bike share for more leisurely activities then week day riders.
